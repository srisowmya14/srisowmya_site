<h2>Following are few <u style="color:#DBC71E;">tips for your career</u>:</h2>
<h3 style="color:#385BC1;">
Is good GPA must for your career?</h3>
<p> Good GPA indicates that you are motivated to succeed and can handle pressure. It is beneficial if you have it,
 but at the same time it shows only your theoretical knowledge. I have few friends whose GPA is just average but have equally or even more skill set than the person with highest GPA.<br>
Most companies look for 3.00 GPA, and people who have equal to or greater than the mark are considered the same. So, don't worry if your GPA is between 3 to 3.5, all you need is to update yourself with the technology
.

<h3 style="color:#385BC1;">
Are the skills mentioned in your resume match with the job requirements you have applied for?</h3>
<p> Knowing your goal and applying for the right position your looking for is very important. Do not get upset when you apply for 100 jobs and dint receive any calls, 
when what you did was applying to each and every job posting which are just remotely related to your skill set. Sending your resume multiple times for different positions in a single company is a bad practice. </p>

<h3 style="color:#385BC1;">
No job, but great skills? Try Freelancing</h3>
<p>If you are a person who is interested in web development or have good coding skills but still dint find any job, then try freelancing. Freelance workers are the ones who are self-employed,
 you can do projects remotely for a company who pay you for your work. There is no long-term commitment and you can leave it anytime you wanted to. It is a great experience to do projects and which in turn helps you for job hunt.</p>
